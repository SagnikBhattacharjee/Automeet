# Security Notif

## Declaration:

I, Pavana Narayana Bhat, the creator of this project, doesnot guarantee the security provided by the script incase of data breaches.
However, it is guaranteed that the credentials that a user(you) enter into the program to login to user's Google account is sufficient to run the program.
Please note that **Automeet** saves **NO** passwords or usernames once entered. The credentials that the user gives will be **completely** erased at the time of re-direction to *[Google Meet](https://meet.google.com)*. Check the source code for more information. And the executables are created using **_[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)_**

Do note that the login is completely **Authorised** and secure by **_[stackauth](stackauth.com)_**.

### Found any bugs?
Incase you find any bugs, please raise an *[Issue Ticket](https://github.com/pixincreate/Online-Class-Automater/issues/new)* under the *[Issues Tab](https://github.com/pixincreate/Online-Class-Automater/issues)* of this Repository. Will look into it, then solve the issue if it exist.

### Why redirection?
Google by default has restricted the direct user login on unrecognised browsers due to security concerns. In order to bypass the restriction(in order to automate the things), the user is supposed to login via *[stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)* that uses OAuth authorisation to login securely.
