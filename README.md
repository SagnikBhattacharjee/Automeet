To download the **lastest** release, click **_[here](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/releases/latest)_**.

### Introduction:
As the name says, Automeet is all about automating the process of logging **in** and **out** when attending a Meeting on Google Meet platform with a single run. Automeet is mainly targeted for the employees and Students out there to help them out manage their time which is basically wasted in waiting to attend sessions and clickings!

**Code by:** Pavana Narayana Bhat

### PreRequisites:
- **Windows** Operating system.
- Google Chrome / Brave (v**85.0** or **above**).
- A Google **Account**.
- **Stable Internet** connection.

### Usage:
- Once the **PreRequisites** is satisfied, you're almost done. **Download** the executable from the *[releases section](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/releases)*.
- Run the **Automeet.exe**.
- Enter your **Google Account Login Credentials** that you used to join your online meetings.
- Chill all day long watching the automation.

### Things to keep in mind:
- Please make sure that the Google Meet meetings are scheduled on your Google Calendar and the timings doesnot overlap with each other(like 2 meetings at the same time             or whatever).
- Also, do note that the **Password** that you enter is not visible(neither in ```*```), instead you'll see nothing but empty space.
- User will get an error stating **```valueError```** when a user interferes at the time of Auromation. Just re-run the **Automeet**.

### Working:
- On logging in to your Google Account, **Automeet** will fetch the day's **scheduled meetings**.
- Then updates them in the console for you with timings.
- If the meeting is not yet started, it will wait till 1m 30s before the scheduled time.
- When participants' count **reduces** to/below the **1/4th** of the total strength **or** if *```"Several participants left the meeting."/ "User_name stopped recording"```* notification arrives in the meeting when going on, **Automeet** will end the call, and waits for/joins the next one.
- Incase you join the meeting 5 minutes before the next scheduled meeting, it will directly join you for that instead of the previous one.

### Found any bugs?
Incase you find any bugs, please raise an *[Issue Ticket](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/issues/new/choose)* under the *[Issues Tab](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/issues)* of this Repository. Will look into it, then solve the issue if it exist.

**Note:**  A **Warning** exists in both the .py files. To learn more about the warning, click *[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63958561/how-to-merge-chromedriver-exe-with-a-python-script-that-runs-on-selenium-webdriv/63959432#63959432)*.

### FAQ:
*Q*: **Why _Automeet_ is SLOW at Start up**?  
*A*: It is a standalone executable file that contains all the required files to run the **Automeet**. As the executable creates a temporary folder to extract the files that are requierd by the **Automeet** to run during the Start up, it takes around `2 -3` seconds at Max!

*Q*: **Is it safe to use and trustable**?  
*A*: Read the security.md by clicking *[here](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/blob/main/Security.md)* first. Yes, you can trust **Automeet** and its processes. You can check it's **source** by clicking *[here](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/blob/main/Source/Automeet.py)*.

*Q*: **How do I create the EXECUTABLES**?  
*A*: `.exe` has been created using *[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)*.

### Feature updates(that I'm currently thinking to Add):
- Auto attendance (for students) that puts Present Sir/ Mam on behalf of you.
- Exit meetings based on Recording of sessions.
